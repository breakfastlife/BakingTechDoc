        <b>Introduction To Baking</b>
        <p>A good introduction to baking should always include a simple what to expect not someones lifestory. 
            For instance, on a recipe it should start with the desciption of the item you're baking not how someone's mother 
            use to make this for them after a long day at the beach after the family went camping in Hawaii or something like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            For these tutorials, I will give you a list of ingridients, a list of tools needed, baking instructions, and then a section on how to improve, improvise, or substitute ingridients. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we go on, please remember that everyone starts somewhere so if you aren't great from the beginning then keep practicing and you'll eventually get the hang of it.
            Start small and you'll do great. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the introduction, I'm going to go over some safety. 
            <ul>
                <li>For one, if you need to cut anything make sure you do not cut yourself. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you need to watch a video on proper knife work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Fg7l7G1zw">here is a good one</a>.
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    When using the stove or oven, make sure you do not touch anything hot with your bare hands. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please us an oven mit when handling hot items. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you do not have an oven mitt, you can use a dish rag.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Warning: make sure you can grip the item properly while using the rag
                            before the item is hot so you know if this will work or not.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Note: Be sure to read the list of tools and ingredients before starting to make sure you have everything you need. /nl

            Going to the store halfway through making something sucks.

                <b class="instructions-step">Step 1</b>
                <p>Preheat the Oven to 350 degrees F (or 175 degrees C)</p>
                <p>Preheating the oven is crutial as you want the oven to be up to temp when you start baking. If its too cold the cookies wont bake correctly.</p>
                <b class="instructions-step">Step 2</b>
                <p>Mix the peanut butter, sugar, and egg together in the bowl until smooth.</p>
                <p>If you're using the optional vanilla, add it in with the rest of the ingridients.</p>
                <b class="instructions-step">Step 3</b>
                <p>Make the baking sheet non-stick using one of the following meathods: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spray baking sheet with non-stick spray.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cover baking sheet with parchment paper.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spray baking sheet with non-stick spray and then put parchment paper over the spray.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Note: using parchment paper is the easy clean up/less dishes method.
                </p>
                <b class="instructions-step">Step 4</b>
                <p>Roll some of the batter into 1-inch balls and place them at least 1-inch apart.</p>
                <b class="instructions-step">Step 5</b>
                <p>Flatten each using the fork in a criss-cross pattern</p>
                <b class="instructions-step">Step 6</b>
                <p>Bake until firm, about 10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet before attempting to remove them. Then cool them off even more.</p>
                <b class="instructions-step">Step 7</b>
                <p>Repeat steps 4-6 until all batter is baked into cookies.</p>
                <b class="modify">How to Modify the Peanut Butter Cookies</b>
                <p>
                    One way to change or modify the peanut butter cookies is to add some complimentary flavors. One of
                    which I put as an optional ingredient, vanilla. I personally tend to add a Tbsp of cinnamon as it
                    adds a depth of flavor that compiments the peanut butter flavor.
                    If you need to substitute eggs, you can do one of the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You can use 1 tsp (teaspoon) of baking soda and 1 Tbsp of vinegar (Per Egg)

                <b class="instructions-step">Step 2</b>

                    <li>
                        Creaming means, mix at high speeds (using electric mixer) until fully combine and has the consistancy of cream.

                <b class="instructions-step">Step 4</b>

                <ul>
                    <li>Try to give them 1 - 2 Inches of space between each cookie. Chocolate chip cookies tend to spread out as they're baking.</li>

                <b class="instructions-step">Step 8</b>

                <b class="modify">How to Modify the Peanut Butter Cookies</b>
                <p>
                    One way to change or modify the cookies is to replace the chocolate chips with another ingridient. When I make peanut butter cookies, I will actually make this
                    recipe and then replace the chocolate chips with 1 cup of peanutbutter. This will make soft and buttery peanut butter cookies. You can also mix in white 
                    chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, dark chocolate, chopped up chocolate bars, caramel, m&m's, vanilla chips, ect. These cookies are a very versitile cookie and 
                    you can literally just replcae 1 ingredient and get so many variations.
                    You can also add 1/2 cup - 2/3 cup of cocoa powder into the batter and it'll make it into a chocolate base cookie with chocolate chips.

                One way to modify the vanilla cake is to not use buttercream frosting. You can top it with fresh jam, cream and fresh fruit, chocolate frosting, 
                ice cream, caramel, a crumble topping, lemon glaze, a glaze with chopped nuts, honey, ect.

            <b class="instructions">Baking Instructions</b>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 1</b>
            <p>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the water sugar and yeast. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If using active dry yeast, let the mixture bubble and foam before proceeding (this can take 3-5 minutes).</li> 
                <li>If using instant yeast, proceed with the recipe (no need to let the yeast activate).</li>
            </ul>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 2</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the salt, oil and 3 cups of flour and mix.</li> 
                <li>Add in 2 1/2 to 3 more cups of flour gradually. </li>
                <li>The dough should clear the sides of the bowl and form a soft ball that doesn't leave a lot of dough residue on your fingers.</li>
            </ul>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 3</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Knead for 2-3 minutes until the dough is smooth. </li>
                <li>If the dough starts to cling to the sides of the bowl (or the center column if using a Bosch or other mixer with a center), add 1/4 cup of flour at a time until a sturdy but soft ball of dough forms.</li>
            </ul>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 4</b>
            <p>Choose the method for the rising method.</p>    
            <ul>
                <li>Rising Method 1: Leave the dough in the mixer, cover with a lid or towel, and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Stir it down by turning on the mixer for 10 seconds or so. Repeat the "rest and stir down" cycle five more times.</li>
                <li>Rising Method 2: Instead of letting the dough rest for 10 minute spurts and then stirring it down, transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover with a towel or greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled, about an hour or so, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.</li>
            </ul>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 5</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface and divide in half.</li> 
                <li>Pat each section into a thick rectangle, 9X13-inches or thereabouts (doesn't have to be exact). </li>
                <li>Roll the dough up starting from the long edge, pressing out any air bubbles or seams with the heel of your hand, and pinch the edge to seal. </li>
                <li>Arrange seam side down on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper (I use separate baking sheets for each loaf).</li>
            </ul>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 6</b>
            <p>>With a bread lame, razor blade or VERY sharp knife, cut several gashes at an angle on the top each loaf (you can wait to score the bread until after it rises, but it can easily deflate if the razor/knife isn't sharp enough).</p>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 7</b>
            <p>Cover the loaves with greased plastic wrap or a kitchen towel, and let rise until noticeably puffy and nearly doubled in size, about an hour.</p>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 8</b>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and make sure an oven rack is in the center position. If you find your bread isn't browning as much as you like, preheat the oven to 400 or 425 degrees and/or move the oven rack up one position (watch carefully so the bread, especially the bottom, doesn't burn).</p>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 9</b>
            <p>Optional: for an extra golden, crisp crust, place the loaves in the preheated oven and immediately toss 3-4 ice cubes on the bottom of the oven. Close the oven door quickly but gently.</p>
            <b class="instructions-step">Step 10</b>
            <p>Bake the loaves for 25-30 minutes until golden and baked through.</p>
            <b class="modify">How to Modify the brownies</b>
            <ul>
                <li>If desired, brush melted butter over the hot loaves (this softens the crust a bit, so if you want a crispier crust, don't butter the top).</li>
                <li>If you want to use Whole Wheat Flour, add 2-3 minutes of kneading so the gluten can develop.</li>
