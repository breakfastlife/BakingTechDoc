        <header>Introduction To Baking</header>
        <p>A good introduction to baking should always include a simple what to expect not someones lifestory. 
            For instance, on a recipe it should start with the desciption of the item you're baking not how someone's mother 
            use to make this for them after a long day at the beach after the family went camping in Hawaii or something like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            For these tutorials, I will give you a list of ingridients, a list of tools needed, baking instructions, and then a section on how to improve, improvise, or substitute ingridients. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we go on, please remember that everyone starts somewhere so if you aren't great from the beginning then keep practicing and you'll eventually get the hang of it.
            Start small and you'll do great. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the introduction, I'm going to go over some safety. 
            <ul>
                <li>For one, if you need to cut anything make sure you do not cut yourself. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you need to watch a video on proper knife work <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Fg7l7G1zw">here is a good one</a>.
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    When using the stove or oven, make sure you do not touch anything hot with your bare hands. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please us an oven mit when handling hot items. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you do not have an oven mitt, you can use a dish rag.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Warning: make sure you can grip the item properly while using the rag
                            before the item is hot so you know if this will work or not.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Be sure to read the list of tools and ingredients before starting to make sure you have everything you need. /nl

            Going to the store halfway through making something sucks.

                little ingriedient so if you mess up it's a big deal.

                <p>Preheating the oven is crutial as you want the oven to be up to temp when you start baking. If its too cold the cookies wont bake correctly.</p>

                <header class="modify">How to Modify the Peanut Butter Cookies</header>
                <p>
                    One way to change or modify the peanut butter cookies is to add some complimentary flavors. One of
                    which I put as an optional ingredient, vanilla. I personally tend to add a Tbsp of cinnamon as it
                    adds a depth of flavor that compiments the peanut butter flavor.
                    If you need to substitute eggs, you can do one of the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You can use 1 tsp (teaspoon) of baking soda and 1 Tbsp of vinegar (Per Egg)

                    traditional cookie recipe. The cookies are delicious and have plenty of ways to 
                    modify the recipe.

                <p>
                    One way to change or modify the cookies is to replace the chocolate chips with another ingridient. When I make peanut butter cookies, I will actually make this
                    recipe and then replace the chocolate chips with 1 cup of peanutbutter. This will make soft and buttery peanut butter cookies. You can also mix in white 
                    chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, dark chocolate, chopped up chocolate bars, caramel, m&m's, vanilla chips, ect. These cookies are a very versitile cookie and 
                    you can literally just replcae 1 ingredient and get so many variations.
                    You can also add 1/2 cup - 2/3 cup of cocoa powder into the batter and it'll make it into a chocolate base cookie with chocolate chips.

            <p>
                One way to modify the vanilla cake is to not use buttercream frosting. You can top it with fresh jam, cream and fresh fruit, chocolate frosting, 
                ice cream, caramel, a crumble topping, lemon glaze, a glaze with chopped nuts, honey, ect.
